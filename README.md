# Gym_Tracker
Advanced Excel-based gym tracking system with data visualization and performance analytics.
Good morning! 
I have designed this Comprehensive Gym Tracker to streamline your training process and help you reach your fitness goals through data-driven insights. This tool allows you to monitor your progress, manage fatigue, and visualize your growth over time.
Below you will find a detailed guide on how to get the most out of this system.
1) Dashboard 
<img width="605" height="290" alt="Dashboard_1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/467809e1-9712-404c-9d5b-7619475ca28e" />
<img width="605" height="277" alt="Dashboard_2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0370447-1c48-4a26-98d7-2c87d2ee310c" />

The Dashboard is where your raw data turns into insights. It allows you to visualize your efforts and track performance trends.
•	Year Selector: Filter your training data by year to see long-term progress.
•	Exercise Name Selector: Choose a specific exercise from the list to see your strength trends.
•	Note: The Year and Exercise filters work together to provide a granular view of your performance in a specific timeframe.

2) Sessions
<img width="605" height="66" alt="Sessions" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45efee97-d1c8-45d2-b5f6-196e98c725bc" />

This sheet acts as a diary for your workouts. For every training session, fill in:
•	Training Name: (e.g., Push Day, Leg Day).
•	Start & End Time: Helps track session duration and density.
•	Energy Level: Rate how you felt (useful for identifying recovery issues).
•	Note: Other cells are automated and will calculate durations and links automatically.

3) Exercises

This is your library of movements.
•	Customization: You can delete the examples and add your own exercises.
•	Data Entry: Only use Columns B, C, and D to input names and categories.
•	Automation: Column A (Exercise ID) updates automatically to ensure data integrity

4) Performance

This is your most-used sheet. For every set you perform, log the following:
•	Session ID: Connects the set to the specific session in the "Sessions" tab.
•	Date & Exercise Name: Defines when and what you performed.
•	Set Number, Reps & Weight: The core metrics of your volume.
•	Tip: For bodyweight exercises, enter "1" in the weight column.
•	RIR (Reps in Reserve): A crucial metric for intensity. Type in how many more reps you could have performed with good technique. This helps in managing fatigue and avoiding plateaus.
•	Note: If you try to use an exercise in other sheets that hasn't been added here, the system will display a red "Not found" alert. This ensures that your Dashboard remains accurate and prevents data fragmentation.

5) Weight

A dedicated space to monitor your body weight trends over time.
•	Data Entry: Simply insert the Date and your Weight (in kg/lbs).
•	Analytics Tip: Regular logging in this sheet allows the system to correlate your strength gains (from the Performance sheet) with changes in body mass.

6) Body measurements

While the scale shows one number, this sheet tracks your actual physical transformation. It is essential for monitoring muscle hypertrophy and fat loss (recomposition).
•	Detailed Logs: Track measurements for: Neck, Chest, Biceps, Waist, Stomach, Hips, Thighs, and Calves.
•	Why it matters: Even if your weight remains stable, changes in these measurements (e.g., a decreasing waist and increasing chest/thighs) are clear indicators of successful training progress.

7) Mapping
This sheet is hidden – I dont reccommend to play with this sheet, othwerise if you know what are you doing or want to play – feel free to edit.
